# Anime & Manga Universe

## Overview

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for information about anime, manga, and characters using the Jikan API. The application is built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses Web Components to create reusable UI elements.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** The application uses a responsive grid layout for the search results, which adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Color Scheme:** The application uses a dark color scheme, with a background color of `#1a1a1a` and a primary color of `#6c63ff`.
*   **Typography:** The application uses the 'Bungee' font for headings and 'Roboto' for body text, giving it a modern and stylish look.
*   **Animations:** The application uses a subtle fade-in animation for the search results and a hover effect on the cards to make the page feel more dynamic and engaging.
*   **Header:** The header features a dynamic background image and a prominent title and subtitle.

### Features

*   **Top Anime Recommendations:** The application displays a list of top anime recommendations on the home page.
*   **Search:** Users can search for anime, manga, and characters using separate search inputs.
*   **Results:** The search results are displayed in a card-based layout, with each card showing the title, image, synopsis, and score of the item.
*   **Loading Indicator:** A loading indicator is displayed while the application is fetching data from the API.
*   **"No results found" message:** A "No results found" message is displayed when a search returns no results.
*   **"Read more" link:** The synopsis is truncated to 100 characters, and a "Read more" link is provided to expand or collapse the full text.
*   **"Clear" button:** A "Clear" button is provided to clear the search input and results.
*   **"Back to top" button:** A "Back to top" button is provided to scroll the page to the top.

## Plan

This was the plan for the changes that have been implemented:

1.  **Add a recommendations section:** A new section was added to the home page to display a list of top anime recommendations. This makes the page more engaging for new users.
2.  **Improve the visual design:** The visual design was significantly improved to give the page more personality and make the content more organized and visually appealing. This includes a new font, a more vibrant color palette, a more dynamic layout, and a redesigned header.
3.  **Enhance the result cards:** The result cards were redesigned to include the score of the item and a more refined "Read more" functionality.
4.  **Refactor the JavaScript code:** The JavaScript code was refactored to support the new features and to improve the overall code quality.
5.  **Update the documentation:** The `blueprint.md` file was updated to reflect the new changes.
